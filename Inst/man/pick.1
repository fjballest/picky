.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pick
is a compiler for the picky programming language.
Output is left in
.B p.out ,
unless
.B -o
is used.
Flag
.B -g
permits global variables, which are forbidden otherwise.
All other flags are for debugging:
.B -D
to debug declarations,
.B -L
to debug the lexical analyzer,
.B -E
to debug expressions,
and
.B -S
to report usage statistics.
.PP
.I Pam
is not usually called by hand. Binaries generated by
.I pick
are executable text files, with
PAM assembly, interpreted by
.IR /bin/pam ,
and it suffices to execute them.
The program has no options. All flags are for debugging:
.B -D
to debug data,
.B -F
to debug input files,
.B -M
to debug dynamic memory,
.B -S
to dump the stack after executing instructions,
.B -X
to report instructions as they are executed,
.B -I
to debug file I/O builtins,
and
.B -N
to report statistics (numbers) after execution.
